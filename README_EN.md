# A Research Of Training Data Augmentation For Deep Learning

## About the code

- **generate_images.py**: It can generate 100 pieces of picture from one picture with doing some basic shift on it.
- **train.py**: It is a construction of CNN based on Keras. I used the construct of ResNet to create it. we can regard it as a simplify ResNet construction.It relates to the /keras-data-augmentation-res/pyimagesearch/resnet.py
- **classify.py**: It can test the model which has been trained. The test data was saved in the fold named example.

## Training data

In this paper, I use the training data from < Kaggle: Dogs vs. Cats　dataset >. But I just used a part of it. If you want to learn more, please visit the URL: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats
